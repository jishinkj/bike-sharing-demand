# Bike Sharing Demand

This is a repository for this [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bike-sharing-demand). There are 2 parts to this repo. 

1. [eda.ipynb](eda.ipynb) contains the Exploratory Data Analysis part, which includes the preprocessing and cleaning code. 
2. [modeling.ipynb](modeling.ipynb) contains the modeling code. This is more like the part-2 of the first notebook. Going through this notebook will make sense too.
